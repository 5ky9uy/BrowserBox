Embeddable, multiplayer browser for RBI and applications. 

Developers build real-time integrations of remote web content right into their own web app. Cyber professionals use Remote Browser Isolation to add protection to client devices from web-based threats and 0-days exploits. 

BrowserBox enables you to roll-your-own lightweight VPN for browser virtualization, concealing your real IP and using end-to-end encryption from the site. See our other StackScripts here in future for extended options, such as BrowserBox over Tor.

Once your instance is creating and you have its IP address, add an A record at your DNS provider (like GoDaddy, Name.com, or the specific one you use) to point the hostname you fill out below for your BrowserBox instance (HOSTNAME_FIELD) to the IP address of your Linode. Your login link will then be:

  https://<HOSTNAME_FIELD>:8080/login?token=<TOKEN_FIELD>

Anyone with this link can use your remote browser, so guard it well!
