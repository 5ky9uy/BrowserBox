Ensure you have forked or generated the repo to your own account (not an org account) first, and then all you need to do is click the "Submit New Issue" button and follow the steps that show up in your issues comments. 

Your [BrowserBox](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox) ephemeral private VPN will then be created. Follow any prompts that arise in the prompts here and you'll be soon browsing the web securely and privately!
