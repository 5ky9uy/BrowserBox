## Licensing

### For open-source use

If you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the [GNU AGPL license v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html), you may use BrowserBox Pro under the terms of the AGPLv3.

### For non-commercial use

You can use BrowserBox Pro for free for non-commercial use cases. 

This means government and public institutions, non-profits, private researchers and individuals are covered by this protection when their use is done without any anticipation of commercial application. This is provided under the terms of the [Polyform Non-Commercial License 1.0](LICENSE.md#noncommercial-license).

From time to time, our non-commercial users may desire an license arrangement different to the one provided by the standard [Polyform Non-Commercial License 1.0](LICENSE.md#noncommercial-license) to suit their needs both now and in future, and such terms may be approved and negotiated on a case-by-case basis typically for a fee or other remunerative or protective arrangement. 

### For commercial, closed-source, non-AGPL or other proprietary use

The commercial license is designed to for you to use BrowserBox Pro in commercial products and applications, without the provisions of the AGPLv3. With the commercial license, your code is kept propietary. If you want to use BrowserBox Pro to develop commercial sites, sercvices, projects, and applications, the commercial license is the appropriate license.

### Purchasing a commercial license

Purchasing takes a minute. Our purchasing form accepts credit cards, bank transfers and many other forms of payment. Once purchased, you’ll receive a commercial license PDF and you will be all set to use BrowserBox Pro in your commercial applications. With the purchase of a commercial license:

- You may use BrowserBox Pro in as many commercial applications you like.
- You may use BrowserBox Pro in your own commercial applications and products. For example: premium VPN services, RBI systems, system integration portals, web automation and scraping products, educational platforms, and other products and apps.
- Customers and users of your products do not need to purchase their own license — so long as they are not developing their own commercial products with BrowserBox Pro.

*Please note that we cannot transact with sanctioned countries, entities or individuals.* 

Commercial Licenses are priced per seat. A seat is someone who uses the BrowserBox Pro system, either in an internal application (like secure email attachment viewing), or an external customer-facing application (such as a customer of your remote browser isolation product). Commercial Licenses come in two flavors:

- **Perpetual License** This is a license to use the version of BrowserBox Pro you purchase forever. The version can be updated to the latest via purchase of yearly licenses.
- **Yearly License** This is a license to use the latest version available within the 12-months from your purchase. It can be manually renewed every year, or you can subscribe so it renews automatically.

Commercial Licenses are available in two sizes:

- **Individual License** Purchasable at [our GumRoad site](https://dosyo.gumroad.com). This is suitable for individuals or small teams working on commercial projects who don't want to use the AGPLv3.
- **License Pack** Available in multiple sizes, from the small to the truly epic, with commensurately epic discounts at scale. These are purchasable at [our main website](https://dosyago.com).

By obtaining a commercial license, you gain the freedom to tailor BrowserBox Pro to your specific requirements and integrate it seamlessly into your workflow. This empowers organizations to leverage the advanced features and capabilities of BrowserBox Pro while maintaining full control over its customization and usage. 

Support tiers and customization may be separately negotiated and purchased. To discuss your needs, please [reach out to our helpful support team here](mailto:support@dosyago.com?subject=BrowserBox%20Pro).

### Hardware Appliance (OEM) Licensing

Are you an OEM and want to deploy BBPro on a hardware device that you sell to your customers? [Contact us for special access to Appliance License pricing with Volume Discounts](mailto:sales@dosyago.com?subject=OEM%20License). This pricing sheet and terms are tailored to suit OEM's delivering security products for business and industry. Please note that if you are supplying government or other non-commercial users you cannot "pass through" DOSYAGO's non-commercial license to your customers without licensing a Commercial license from us. 

### Sanctions Compliance

Unfotunately if you or your company are an OFAC sanctioned entity or other entity sanctioned by the US Government (e.g. designated on OFAC's SDN List, BIS's DPL or Entity List, DDTC's DPL, or on the FBI's various lists, among others) we are unable to offer you a license of any form. Please note that in some cases we may conduct necessary checks to ensure sanctions compliance. 

### Licensing Summary

As previously mentioned, BBPro software is available for free for non-commercial use under the PolyForm NonCommercial license. This allows individuals and non-profit organizations to enjoy the benefits of BrowserBox Pro without any licensing fees when using the software without any participation in or anticipation of commercial application.
