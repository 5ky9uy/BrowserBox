- fix macos native (non docker) version. screen cast issues seemingly. possible race due to super low lag of running local
- create a "print" dialog to intercept the window.print function or beforeprint event. Throw up our own config modal and use printToPDF (ensure secure so no active scripts in pdf).
- fix the sensitive "1 per hour session expired" erroneous alert on navigate away etc.
