- put chai state files (pid.txt, pdfs/**, etc...) into user config directory $HOME/.config/... because we need perms to write them and in current set up chai is trying to write within the install directory which is root permed and so fails

- also chai uses a sudo command and the bb users do not have this capability so we need to reconfig those parts. maybe it's a cap? or maybe we won't need sudo if we move the state files? look at

- fix test for menu open on mobile

- refine adaptive tests and change cast seldom

- add screen reset on tab change ( otherwise the prior tab lingers a little too long )

- fix clipboard write on Safari https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/691873

- if you restart your browser, you probably expect tabs to come back up, so we likely need to save a list of tabs. saved in a file under home, like

*url,yscroll
url,yscroll
url,yscroll

updated every tab change (not on every scroll). * indicates active tab. Nice, simple format. 

- factor out get_install_dir and other funcs into something we can source into all the scripts that use it

- add check for node_modules in bbpro install dir (otherwise we may try to launch of one that hasn't been installed!)

- attach to any restored tabs.
