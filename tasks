bunch of issues and problems in ime

- getters on state object are not being serialized across on object component states  (so we cannot read these states)
- can keys input is not consistent (someone ime detection will not be fired because input is not focused as it should be)

other

- create a stopbb function that sends a "shut down message" to the instance and waits 10 seconds then runs pm2 delete all
