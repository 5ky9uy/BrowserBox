switch tab cast delay
- check to see if we are getting and dropping frames from the old tab
- check to see if we are continuing to ack frames from the old tab (or send other messages to old tab after activation)
- implement new tab act blast until first frame from new tab received to counter delay

slow macos first page.navigate on first tab
- inspect node process and put breakpoint on navigate to see what's occuring
- minimal repro example of slow Page.navigate (subsequent events)
