slow macos first page.navigate on first tab
- inspect node process and put breakpoint on navigate to see what's occuring
  - nothing appears to be happening that's unusual
- add event log to inspect
  - seems delay comes after requestPaused. This makes sense. Perhaps it is first load of our requestPaused handling code? I could try a preload somehow, this could be a NodeJS compile cache issue.
  - found! problem confirmed to be with adblock code, but only on first request. My guess is compilation of the regexp.
- minimal repro example of slow Page.navigate (subsequent events)

switch tab cast delay
- check to see if we are getting and dropping frames from the old tab
- check to see if we are continuing to ack frames from the old tab (or send other messages to old tab after activation)
- implement new tab act blast until first frame from new tab received to counter delay
