This works. 3 in a row

1. Connect Admin computer to Windows Server (Main RDP)

2. Connect Windows Server to itself (Nested RDP) from regular powershell.

3. From nested RDP created BrowserBox from regular powershell.

4. From Main RDP create VNC to itself from regular powershell.

5. From Main RDP point Main RDP at console using admin powershell.

-- Audio persists

------------------------

I guess what is happening is:

once session is in console, it stays alive to keep the nested rdp and its tasks alive.

but without the inner vnc to itself, it will have no gui, which will cascade down to the nested rdp having no gui, 

so while it would remain connected probably the audio driver would switch off. 

So in short
the console keeps the session alive even tho we are not connected
the inner vnc keeps the console session "open" or "active" 
And The nested RDP ensures that we have an audio device operating.

Try again

Connect Admin Computer to Server (main RDP).

Connect Server to Itself (Nested RDP).

From nested RDP create BrowserBox.

From Main RDP create VNC to itself or from admin computer create vnc to server.

Point main RDP at console using administrator powershell

Audio will persist
