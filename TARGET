- fix macos Meta key (meta + click for open in new tab) when running server on macos
- fix macos native (non docker) version. screen cast issues seemingly. possible race due to super low lag of running local
- create a "print" dialog to intercept the window.print function or beforeprint event. Throw up our own config modal and use printToPDF (ensure secure so no active scripts in pdf).
